# **Orbis Education Homework Assignment**

The goal of this assignment is to test your knowledge of JavaScript and React by completing the tasks below. It shouldn't take more than a few hours. Send us back your code when you're done. Good luck!

## **Guidelines**

This application should display the current weather for a zip code, which is entered by the user. It should list the predicted weather for three, six, and nine hours out, and also show an extended five-day forecast.

## **Tasks**

1. Prompt user for their zip code.
2. Display the hourly forecast, in three hour segments. (Ex: if it is currently 12:00pm, the application should show predicted weather at 3:00pm, 6:00pm, and 9:00pm.)
3. Display the extended five-day forecast.

## **Bonus Tasks**

- Pre-populate the weather based on the user's location.
- Please provide documentation on how you built your program and explain your reasoning.
- Add any extra design elements or formatting you see fit.
- Feel free to add any other functionality or extend this project.
